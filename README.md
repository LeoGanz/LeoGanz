# Overview of my public projects

## [AutomataLearningAco](https://github.com/LeoGanz/AutomataLearningAco)
Java project that was developed as the basis of my bachelor thesis. Ideas on applying ant colony optimization algorithms to automata learning were explored and implemented. The code base includes an application for visualizing the state of learning. Tools for parameter tuning and evaluation of learned results are available as well. Please contact me if you'd like to get access to the thesis.

_Team_: solo
